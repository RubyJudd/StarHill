			<h3 class="topicHeading mb-5" >Trauma counselling for birth mothers and children/adults affected by the adoption process 
			</h3> 

			<p class="main"> I provide counselling to <span class="bold">birth mothers</span>. Older adoptions were often motivated by the shame and censure of an ‘illegitimate’ pregnancy. The mother had little choice and was subjected to intense pressure. Often she was not allowed to hold or view her baby, and wasn't told if her baby lived or died or even what gender. This trauma was seldom acknowledged or processed. At reunion it is often the first time a birth mom allows herself to mourn or grieve or address this trauma, which can remain fresh even years later. I help them to acknowledge and validate the loss and work through any unresolved grief.
			</p>
			<p class="main"> I also provide counselling to <span class="bold">adults affected by their adoption</span>. Often the trauma relating to the separation from your birth mother as a child is difficult to conceptualize or remember. It registers in a way that is not conscious or able to be articulated. There is only a feeling at a deeper level of something missing or lost and the inevitable question (despite feeling loved by adoptive parents) - “why was I give-awayable?” It can be at the root of feelings of depression, vague unease, anger, guilt, and trust issues. When psychic trauma is so deep that the memories are stored as implicit memory, finding creative modes for acknowledging, confronting and re-articulating grief is crucial to bring healing. I have training in the use of visual arts, the creative process, and therapeutic techniques. By way of symbols and metaphors, these help access the parts of the brain where trauma is stored and aid in processing unresolved or distressing experiences in a safe and unthreatening context. 

			  <!-- Read more on processing trauma as adoptees here and more about art therapy here. -->
			</p>
			<p class="main"> I also work with <span class="bold">young adopted children</span> with play and arts therapy. In a therapeutic relationship, play and art helps children cope with past feelings of rejection, abuse or loss. In acting out mistrust and anger through stories and toys, they can be relieved of some of their burden. We can explore helpful and unhelpful stories. As Cathy Malchiodi, in her book Creative Interventions with Traumatized Children (2008), writes - never underestimate the importance and “usefulness of play in helping adoptive children […] negotiate and facilitate new meanings in their lives”.
