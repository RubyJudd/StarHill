This is a small group and online space where we will share our adoption stories. I would really like to hear a story from your life, it does not need to be rehearsed! and it does not need to be longer than 5 minutes.

This may seem daunting but storytelling is a way to connect (in a non-scary way) with other people who are going through the same thing as you.

				Storytelling is where we get our dignity back, where we make sense of our hurt, where we deepen our connections and where we make sense of who we are
