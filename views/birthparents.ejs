				Contact with the child you placed in adoption can be redemptive and healing, providing an opportunity to explain your reasons for choosing adoption and a sense of closure to discover how they doing and their circumstances. A reunion often results in a huge burden of shame and guilt being lifted off your shoulders. It may be the first time that have heard the news that your child was well adjusted and established. Often adopted people are grateful for the opportunity to grow up in a stable family and contrary to your fear, hold no ill will towards you. Of course it does not always go well or smoothly and it is a difficult relationship, but there is nearly always a sense of closure and relief for both parties.

				It is important to read up about adoption, receive counselling or attend a support group to  prepare prior to reunion. It often helps to clarify if there was anything amiss in the process. Was there coercion? A lack of information? Were your rights explained? Current adoptions strive to make sure that all options are explored and all the facts and your rights - both legal and otherwise - are made known. Sadly, supporting a mother was not always the focus of social services. If you were given no choices, no offer of a place to live, and no help, then your experience of surrendering baby might have been a “gun to the head" due to bad faith, a conflict of interest, coercion or thought reform tactics (Soll, 2000). This constitutes unfair and unjust treatment. The pressure and motivation for adoption should never be the shame and condemnation of 'illegitimacy'.

				Perhaps there was no pressure or coercion, you simply were not able to parent. Biological family isn't always automatically better than a carefully screened family. If you were not able to parent due to your circumstances such as extreme youth, lack of support, illness/disability-physical or psychological, addiction, domestic abuse or economic straits - this can be your choice to place your baby in a family. In this way you provide for the care and stability that you so desire for them but sadly and realistically they would not receive if you tried to parent. It is a devastatingly hard but unselfish decision.

				Counselling and therapy before meeting your child is extremely important for those for whom the trauma remains fresh years later. The unresolved trauma that the meeting may trigger could result in a type of reappearance of the young traumatized mother you once were. Your adopted child (although also bringing a hurt inner child to the reunion) is quite likely to be approaching the meeting to a greater extent as an adult. The scenario of an emotional minefield is set as explained in this quote:

			  <p class="mb-0">Sadly,……..the mother who reconnects with her child is this young, traumatized mother who was never allowed to talk about her feelings of loss and grief. Because surrender was forced upon her, and because it was mandatory that she hide and bury her true thoughts and feelings, she was, and continues to be, emotionally constructed to fail in reunion. For some the denial was deeper and therefore delayed reactions such as grief and anger are stronger. In others, grief was immediate and less repressed. Our stories of surrender are varied, but for one in three they are the same: we were separated from our babies, the trauma of our loss is not going away</p>

Combining the creative process and therapeutic relationship with your counsellor will bring healing to the psyche and reprocess pain. Hold a ritual marking or commemorating the loss of your child. Plant a memorial garden, write a poem, release beautiful sky lanterns or balloons, take photos of something in nature that helps you feel closer to your child (light, butterflies, flowers, dragonflies), celebrate their birthday in a big or small way, write a letter to them or light a candle for them (Warren, 2016).</p>

There are certain questions that the child will want to know about why they were adopted. The most important thing is to say “you were loved and I've never stopped thinking of you”. Also it is good to say I'm so sorry that I wasn't in a position to raise you myself” You are virtual strangers so keep very sad details for later. It is also important to add that you don't want to interfere in their lives in anyway and will accept what decision they make regarding contact. Address them by their new name if you know it or birth name, and when signing a letter, sign it with your name, do not begin by addressing it to my son/daughter from your mother.
